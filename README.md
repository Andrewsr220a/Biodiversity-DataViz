In this repository I used data aggrated from the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, it catalogs the microbes that colonizes human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

I created the dashboard using Plot.ly. I was able to create 3 different interactive visualizations. The dashboard also contains a table with demographic information. All the information is filterable by a drop downlist. 

Tools: 
  - Html, CSS, Bootstrap
  - Plot.ly
  - D3 library
